Facebook lookup for reddit
==============

This Chrome extension looks up reddit usernames via the Facebook API
and displays the information if a potential match is found.  
All you need to do is install it and hover over peoples' usernames.

I built this because I wanted to learn how to write extensions for 
Chrome and I wanted to make a point about online privacy.

People should be aware of the fact that using your common 
username for facebook will make it very easy to identify you.
